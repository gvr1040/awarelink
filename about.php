        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Upload your medical documentation through our secure form. We verify the information and send a message to your specified partner(s). We will notify you when your information has been verified and sent out.</p>
        

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At AwareLink, we understand that it can be sometimes difficult to notify partners about STD status. That's why we've created a confidential and secure way to anonymously share important health updates to others.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Team </h2>
        <p> We are a team of students from Rochester Institute of Technology who are committed to the Women in Computing Organization. We are dedicated to providing a confidential platform to curb not only the spread of STDs, but the misinformation surrounding STDs.  </p>
